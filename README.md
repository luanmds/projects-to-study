### EncryptStreamProject
A study project focused on Architecture and Engineering Software patterns, implementing microservices that communicate through Kafka messaging. The project demonstrates various enterprise patterns including:
- Domain Logic Patterns (Service Layer, Domain Model)
- Data Source Patterns (Data Mapper)
- Object-Relational Patterns (Unit of Work, Identity Field)
- Domain-Driven Design patterns (Repository, Value Object)
- Distribution Patterns (DTO)
- And more architectural patterns

The project consists of three integrated applications and requires Docker for running the Kafka platform. For detailed setup instructions, check the project's README.
